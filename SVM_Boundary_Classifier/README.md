🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM) – The Boundary Finder

This project shows how AI learns to draw invisible boundaries between two different groups —
like separating 🐱 cats and 🐶 dogs using math and geometry.

🎯 Objective

Train an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model to separate two classes of data
and visualize the decision boundary with maximum margin.

🧩 Concepts Used

Support Vectors: Key data points that define the boundary.

Decision Boundary: The line that separates two classes.

Margin: The buffer zone around the boundary.

Kernel = Linear: Uses straight-line separation (you can later try curved ones like rbf).

A plot shows:

🔲 Red and Blue points (two classes)

⚫ Black-circled points (support vectors)

⚫ Solid and dashed lines (decision boundary and margins)

🌱 Learnings

SVMs use geometry + optimization to find the best dividing line.

Not all data is separable by straight lines — next, we’ll learn non-linear kernels to handle that!

You now understand how math becomes geometry in AI.
