# Student Score Predictor
This is my first ML project using Python and Linear Regression.
- I used data: Hours Studied → Scores.
- I learned that `fit()` means the computer learns the pattern.
- I learned that `predict()` means it guesses new results.
- Goal: Build small ML projects daily and understand math behind them.
