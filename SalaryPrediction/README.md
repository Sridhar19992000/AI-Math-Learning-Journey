Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
📘 Project Overview

This mini-project predicts a person’s salary based on their years of experience using Linear Regression — one of the simplest and most powerful algorithms in Machine Learning.

🧮 What I Learned

How to load real-world CSV data into Python using pandas.

How Linear Regression learns a mathematical formula (like y = mx + b) from data.

The meaning of slope (m) and intercept (b) in a prediction model.

How to visualize data with matplotlib and see how well the model fits.

How to make predictions for new unseen data (e.g., a person with 7.5 years experience).

⚙️ Steps in the Notebook

Import libraries — pandas, matplotlib, sklearn.

Load the dataset (Salary_Data.csv).

Train the model using LinearRegression().

Print the learned formula:

Salary = 9.78 * Experience + 2.48


Predict for new experience:

Predicted Salary for 7.5 years = $75.80K


Visualize:

🔵 Blue dots: Actual salaries

🔴 Red line: Learned prediction line

🧠 Key Concept

Machine Learning finds the best-fit line through the data by minimizing error (MSE).
This helps predict salaries even when data isn’t perfectly aligned — just like estimating real-life outcomes.

📊 Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

🌱 Next Step

Experiment by changing data points or testing new values for experience to see how predictions shift.
