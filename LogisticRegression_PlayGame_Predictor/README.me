🧠 Logistic Regression – The Smart Probability Predictor

This project demonstrates how a computer can predict decisions using math and probabilities instead of just if–else logic.
It’s where AI starts to think like:

“I’m 80% sure the player will play today.”

🎯 Objective

Predict whether a person will Play or Not Play based on Weather and Temperature, using Logistic Regression (a mathematical model).

🧩 Concepts Used

Logistic Regression: Uses the sigmoid function to convert results into probabilities.

Confusion Matrix: Helps evaluate true vs. false predictions.

Accuracy Score: Measures how well the model performs.

Feature Encoding: Converts text values like “Sunny” or “Hot” into numbers.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-Learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

📊 Sample Output
Predictions: [1 0 1]
Actual: [1 0 1]
Accuracy: 1.0
Confusion Matrix:
 [[2 0]
 [0 1]]
Prediction for Sunny & Mild: Yes

🌱 Learnings

Logistic Regression is the mathematical foundation for many AI models.

It uses probabilities instead of strict rules — making it great for real-world uncertainty.

The sigmoid curve shows how even small changes in input can shift outcomes.
