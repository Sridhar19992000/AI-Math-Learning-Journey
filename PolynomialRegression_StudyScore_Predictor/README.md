📘 Polynomial Regression – Study Score Predictor

This project shows how AI can learn curved relationships instead of just straight lines.
In real life, progress is not always linear — studying twice as long doesn’t always double your score 📈.
Polynomial Regression helps AI understand that curvy pattern.

🎯 Objective

Predict a student’s exam score based on the hours studied,
using a Polynomial Regression model to fit non-linear data.

🧩 Concepts Used

Polynomial Features: Extends linear regression to learn curves.

Overfitting vs Underfitting: Learn how too simple or too complex models behave.

Curve Fitting Visualization: Shows how data points bend naturally.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

📊 Sample Output
Predicted score for 7.5 hours of study: 80.45


(You’ll also see a red curve fitting beautifully through the blue points!)

🌱 Learnings

Linear regression draws straight lines, but polynomial regression draws curves 🌈

It helps AI understand real-world non-linear behavior like growth, learning, or demand over time.

Higher polynomial degrees mean more flexibility — but too high can cause overfitting.
