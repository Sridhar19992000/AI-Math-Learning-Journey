# 🏠 House Price Predictor

This project predicts house prices using **Multiple Linear Regression**.

### 🔢 Features used
- **Size** (square feet)
- **Bedrooms**
- **Age** (years)

### 🧠 What I learned
- How to train a machine to learn from multiple inputs.
- How coefficients (weights) tell us how important each feature is.
- How to visualize learning using a graph.

### 📊 Result
The model predicts the price of a house based on its features,  
and the red line shows what the model “learned” compared to the real data.
