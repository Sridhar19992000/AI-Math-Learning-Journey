This project is an upgraded version of the Decision Tree model.
Instead of one tree, the computer now uses a Random Forest — a group of trees that vote together to make a smarter decision.

🎯 Objective

Predict whether a person should Play or Not Play based on Weather and Temperature,
but this time using multiple trees for better accuracy.

🧩 Concepts Used

Random Forest Classifier: Combines multiple decision trees for better stability.

Ensemble Learning: Each tree learns a slightly different pattern, and all vote for the final result.

Categorical Encoding: Converts words (Sunny, Rainy, etc.) into numeric form for training.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Scikit-Learn (RandomForestClassifier)

Matplotlib

🧠 What I Learned

How AI becomes smarter by combining multiple models.

Why Random Forest is more reliable than a single decision tree.

The idea of “voting” in machine learning — each tree contributes its opinion.

📊 Example Output
Prediction for Sunny & Mild: Yes
