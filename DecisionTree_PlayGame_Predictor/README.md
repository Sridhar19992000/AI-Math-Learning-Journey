🧠 Decision Tree Play Game Predictor

This project demonstrates how a computer can make human-like decisions using a Decision Tree Algorithm in Machine Learning.

📘 Objective

To predict whether a person should play or not play based on the weather and temperature conditions.

🧩 Concepts Used

Categorical Encoding: Converting words like “Sunny,” “Rainy,” “Hot,” “Mild” into numbers for the computer to understand.

Decision Tree Algorithm: The model learns rules (if–else logic) to make predictions.

Visualization: The tree structure shows the computer’s decision process step by step.

⚙️ Technologies

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)

Matplotlib

📊 Sample Output

Example Prediction:

Input: Sunny & Mild  
Output: No (Don’t Play)

🌱 Learnings

Computers can learn logical rules automatically from examples.

Decision Trees are the building blocks for advanced AI models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.

Visualization helps us see the brain of the model clearly.
